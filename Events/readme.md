Events
======

> Events have additional sections to record the event summary, event
> start/end dates, location and contact information. Events are always
> part of a calendar. You can use the default calendar or create your
> own custom calendars for logical groupings of events, such as "East
> Coast Sales" for example.

4.  Below the HTML Editor, enter a Summary, Event start and Event end.
    Click the Event start and Event end text boxes to pop up date and

    or take place between specific times of day. The Time zone drop down
    allows you to set the time for the event in another time zone than
    the local time.

> for the event. When the event is over, it is automatically unpublished
> and the event is no longer visible on the page.

    default appearance displays events as a list, but you can elect to

    the Calendar option. Click the Save button.

##### Calendars

> Calendars allow you to logically group events based on any category
> that you require. For example, you could have calendars for each
> department in an organization, sales areas or individual people. An
> event can only belong to a single calendar. To create a calendar:

1.  From Content \> Events, click the Manage Calendars link.

![](../media/image163.png)

2.  Click the Create a calendar button from the toolbar.

3.  Enter the Title of the calendar. Optionally, you can provide a
    Description and use the drop down color picker to choose a custom
    color for the calendar. Click the Create this calendar button.

> the page.
