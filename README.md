> 106 \| FORMS

Forms
=====

> If you want to get information from users, you certainly don\'t want
> to wait for a developer to create a form. Building forms on-the-fly is
> one of the most heavily requested features of Sitefinity. You might
> need to record maintenance requests, user ideas, letters to the
> editor, contact info or any of hundreds of different types of data
> your organization needs to record and stores.
>
> Using Sitefinity you can create your own form easily, without any
> programming. The user fills out the form online, clicks the submit
> button, and the information is stored in the Sitefinity database.
> Forms can either be contained to a single page, or spread across
> multiple pages for a better user experience. You can then review
> responses sent by users or you can export responses to Excel for
> further processing.

##### Creating a Form

> Follow these steps to create a form:

1.  Click the administration menu Content \> Forms item.

2.  Click the Create a form button.

3.  Assign the form Title. You can also assign a name if developers will
    be using the form. The name is filled in automatically based on the
    title but you can also click the change button and use your own
    organization's naming convention.

FORMS \| 107

4.  Under Advanced, leave "MVC only" as the Web framework. The Web
    framework determines how the Form is rendered, and with what Page
    widgets you can use the Form in. MVC only gives you access to a
    smoother experience and unlocks the additional "Page Break" feature,
    which allows you to divide a form into multiple sections. Click the
    Create and go to add content button.

![](./media/image234.png){width="6.020138888888889in"
height="4.370138888888889in"}

5.  The form designer looks very much like the designer for pages,
    except with a different set of widgets. Drag a Textbox widget to the
    box area on the form. Sitefinity knows that you will need a submit
    button to collect the information, so a submit button is added
    automatically along with the Textbox widget.

![](./media/image236.png){width="6.020138888888889in"
height="1.1701388888888888in"}

> 108 \| FORMS

6.  Click the Textbox widget Edit link. The Textbox dialog displays
    showing links for Label and text for the content and instructional
    text and Limitations to validate the Textbox input.

FORMS \| 109

7.  Under Label and text, enter the following:

-   Label: "Email".

-   Placeholder: "<my.email@example.com>".

-   Instructional text: \"Please enter your email address\".

-   Required field: check this box. This will prevent the form from
    being submitted until this field is filled in.

![](./media/image238.png){width="5.5152777777777775in" height="7.05in"}

> 110 \| FORMS

8.  In Limitations \> Range, enter a Min of 5. In the Error message
    displayed\... enter \"Email must be at least 5 characters long\".

9.  Click the Save button to close the dialog. The form should look
    something like the screenshot below.

![](./media/image240.png){width="6.020138888888889in"
height="2.795138888888889in"}

10. Drag a Multiple choice widget onto the form. Click the Edit link.

11. In Label, enter \"Your question is about\...\"

12. The Choices section will have three choices predefined. Change the
    text for the First Choice to \"Classic Cars\" and the Second Choice
    to \"Performance Cars\". Click the x button next to the Third Choice
    to remove it.

13. Select the Add Other as a last choice check box.

14. Select the More Options link. In the Template, select
    Default\_Inline.

15. Click the Save button. The Multiple choice widget on the page should
    now look something like the screenshot below.

![](./media/image242.png){width="3.525in" height="1.625in"}

FORMS \| 111

16. Drag a Paragraph textbox widget onto the form. Click the Edit link.
    Enter the following Label and text:

    -   Label: \"Question\".

    -   Add Instructional text: \"Please enter your question and include
        specific details\".

    -   Required field: Select this checkbox.

17. Click the Save button. The form should now look like the screenshot
    below.

![](./media/image244.png){width="6.020138888888889in"
height="5.745138888888889in"}

> 112 \| FORMS

18. Splitting a Form across multiple pages is easy. Drag a Page Page
    Break widget onto the form, just above the Submit button. Sitefinity
    will automatically divide the form visually for you into two pages,
    providing a common footer that appears on all pages, and showing the
    separation.

![](./media/image246.png){width="5.740277777777778in"
height="6.120138888888889in"}

19. On the new page, above the Submit button, drag another Textbox
    widget out. Give it a Label of "Final Thoughts" and mark it as a
    Required field.

FORMS \| 113

20. On the upper right side of the form, above the widgets, locate the
    Settings button and click it. This will display the Settings area to
    the right of the form.

![](./media/image248.png){width="2.670138888888889in"
height="8.205555555555556in"}

> 114 \| FORMS
>
> Restrictions can be tailored to the particulars of a form. For
> example, for an informal poll you could restrict to only a single IP
> address, that is, each computer would only be able to submit the form
> one time. Attempting to submit the form a second time displays an
> error message to the user. The One entry per username option could be
> useful to collect user registration information. The No Restrictions
> option makes sense for general questions or trouble tickets to a
> support group.
>
> Confirmation options control what the page does when the page is
> submitted. By default a success messaged is displayed on the page. The
> Redirect to a page\... option requires the full Url of the page in the
> form of: <http://mydomain.com/mypage>.
>
> Send email notification for responses to... automatically emails to
> the address associated with your Sitefinity login and to multiple in a
> List of email addresses... The Validate emails verifies the format of
> the email addresses but does not check that they exist. So if you
> entered "\@carconduit.net", that would fail as an invalid email
> address. On the other hand, if "<bob@carconduit.net>" does not exist,
> it will still be valid.

21. Click the Publish button.

##### Adding a Form to a Page

> To add an existing form to a page:

1.  Click the Pages menu item.

2.  Create a new page. For its template, click the Select another
    Template button and select a Bootstrap MVC template of your
    choosing. Otherwise, the form will appear compacted.

3.  Drag a Form widget onto the page. This widget should have "MVC"
    within its logo since we are on an MVC-enabled page. On default
    (hybrid) pages, you will see duplicate widgets for most content: The
    standard widget, and the MVC widget.

4.  Click the Select a form link on the Form widget.

5.  Select a form from the list.

6.  Click the Save button.

7.  Click the Publish button.

8.  Click the View button for the page that contains the form.

9.  Click the Next step button without filling out the form. An error
    message appears to indicate that the field is required. If you type
    a single character into the field and try to advance again, it now
    shows that it must be at least 5 characters long. These errors are
    due to the Required field and Limitations Range \> Min length
    settings.

> **Required message**

##### Viewing Reponses

> Sitefinity maintains a list of all the responses for each form. The
> following will walk you through how to review responses and export
> responses to Excel.

1.  Click the administration menu Content \> Forms. Notice the link to
    the responses.

2.  Click the responses link. The Responses for\... page displays key
    information about each response, one column shows for every field on
    the form.

![](./media/image264.png){width="6.020138888888889in"
height="1.1305555555555555in"}

3.  If you click one of the response items, the detail shows up to the
    right. This detail includes the date and time the response was
    submitted and the IP address origin where the response was sent
    from.

![](./media/image266.png){width="4.105555555555555in" height="2.925in"}

4.  Click the Export as Excel button. This will prompt for a location on
    your hard drive where you can save the Excel file. Displaying
    responses in Excel shows detailed information that includes all the
    form fields.

> 118 \| FORMS

##### Duplicating Forms

> If you need a form that is identical or nearly identical to an
> existing form, the Duplicate feature will create a copy, but will not
> copy the responses for the existing form. Also, the email
> notifications will not be copied. For example, starting with the
> example from [[Creating a Form]{.underline},](#creating-a-form) you
> could duplicate the "Ask CarConduit a question" and make a copy
> specifically for reviewers. To copy an existing form, click he
> Duplicate option from the Forms, Actions menu.

> 120 \| LISTS

Lists
=====

> A List stores a series of values and descriptions. Lists are useful to
> show relatively small collections of codes or other designations. For
> example, you can use lists to track priorities, color coding or
> quality flags. These can be displayed in the page as simple lists,
> expandable lists or anchors. Each List has a title for the list as a
> whole, for example \"Priority\". Each list has a number of items,
> where each item has its own Title and Content such as \"High\",
> \"Medium\" and \"Low\" for example.

Content Blocks
==============

> News, Events and Content Blocks are similar to one another with only
> minor variations. The simplest item of the three is the Content Block
> which contains only a title and some HTML. Content blocks can be
> shared across multiple pages, just as with any other content, or can
> be ad-hoc, one-off material used in a single Content Block widget on a
> single page.
>
> The HTML for the content block can range from blocks of legal language
> to images and links, anything you want to include in various places on
> your site that needs to be maintained in a single spot.

##### Create a Content Block from the Content Menu

Email Campaigns
===============

> Email campaigns are used for appropriate mass mailings such as
> newsletters, announcements and time-sensitive marketing. An email
> campaign has one or more *issues*, where each issue is the actual
> email sent out to users. For example, a monthly newsletter campaign
> can have issues for each month, such as the *January Issue* of the
> *Monthly Newsletter* campaign.
>
> The content for an issue can be as refined as a web page built by a
> professional designer, a complex rich-text document or simple
> plain-text content accessible from any email client. You can create
> personalized content for the email using the same process you already
> use to create pages in Sitefinity.
>
> You can enter the list of users manually, target users already
> registered with your site or import from a spreadsheet. Email
> campaigns are not simple, one-way blasts but allow sophisticated
> tracking of the customer's reaction using mechanisms like A/B
> campaigns that record two different email versions and track which
> messages are opened and what
>
> ![](./media/image310.png){width="3.310416666666667in"
> height="3.4555555555555557in"}links are clicked through.
>
> Use the administration Marketing menu to define a campaign using a
> mailing list, content and how and when the email will be sent. The
> options for creating email campaigns are shown in the screenshot.
>
> As campaign issues go out, email campaign reporting details how the
> email was received; how many were delivered, opened and clicked
> through.

##### Subscribers and Mailing Lists

> Subscribers form the pool of addresses that you can send email to.
> Each subscriber has a first name, last name and email address. Mailing
> lists are groups of subscribers where subscribers can be on more than
> one mailing list. You can get a list of subscribers automatically by
> using the email addresses of users already on your site or from people
> that have responded to forms. You can also import subscribers from
> spreadsheet files or by adding them individually using the Subscribers
> menu option.
>
> The Subscribe widget can be added to a page that site visitors can use
> to "opt-in" and decide to become subscribers. A matching Unsubscribe
> widget can be placed on another page to allow subscribers to opt-out
> of a mailing list. These last two options give your site visitors
> control over the email they receive and allow you to place content
> where it will be well received and get the best reaction.

##### Creating a Mailing List

> To launch a campaign, start by creating a mailing list of subscribers.
> This walk-through demonstrates how to initially setup your mailing
> list first by adding a single subscriber manually and then by adding
> more subscribers using a spreadsheet file. The spreadsheet file can be
> either comma delimited values (\*.csv) or tab delimited (\*.tsv). In
> the example, you'll see how to create a comma separated values file
> (\*.csv) in notepad. Note that you can also create \*.csv files in
> spreadsheet applications like Excel.

1.  Using Notepad, create a file called *Subscribers.csv*. Open the file
    and copy the data below into the file. The first row represents the
    header of the data. The last three rows are made up of email
    address, first name and last name.

##### Build the Products Catalog

> Before you can build a shopping page, a shopping cart and a checkout
> page, you need to setup a catalog of products you want to sell. The
> Ecommerce menu lets you define Products (T-Shirt, baseball cap), Types
> of Products (shirts, hats), and Departments (Clothing, Mens, and
> Womens) and Attributes (size, color).

![](./media/image393.png){width="2.514132764654418in" height="4.5625in"}

##### Departments

> Departments are used to group products. In an example where we are
> selling caps and t-shirts, the department could be *Clothing*.
> Departments are hierarchical, so you could, for example, also create
> sub departments for *Mens*, *Womens*, *Girls* and *Boys* under the
> *Clothing* department.
>

##### Types of products

> Product types help describe how a certain group of products will be
> delivered to the customer. The product can be a traditional shippable
> product, but could also be a downloadable product like software or
> music or even a service or other non-shippable product like a
> subscription.
>
> Fields are added to the product type to describe it further. By
> default, product types start out with Tags and Department fields. Your
> own custom fields take the place of product labeling such as brand
> names, manufacturer codes, ingredients, classifications and codes.
> Using the example of a t-shirt, you could add a brand name, country of
> manufacture, type of fiber and washing instructions.
>

##### Attributes

> Products have traits like color or size called *attributes*. A

##### Products

> Now that [[Departments]{.underline},](#departments) [[Types of
> products]{.underline}](#types-of-products) and
> [[Attributes]{.underline}](#attributes) are defined, you can define
> the individual products. To create the product, you will need to have
> the product name, description, information for any of the fields that
> you defined, the shipping weight, the department that the product is
> part of, price and SKU (stock keeping unit). You may also want to get
> images of each product and have them available on your computer or
> upload them to an image library before defining products. The example
> that follows will create a t-shirt product in several different sizes
> and colors. To create a new product:

1.  From the Ecommerce menu select Products.

2.  You will have a choice of product types to start from. The
    screenshot below uses the Shirt product type.

5.  Next, define the Price, SKU and inventory options for the product.
    The monetary units for the price can be adjusted later in the
    Ecommerce [[ Configuration]{.underline}.](#_bookmark22) The SKU
    (Stock Keeping Unit) can use the numbering system for your store.
    Sitefinity will keep track of basic inventory. The Track inventory
    radio button option allows you to enter a Quantity for all products,
    regardless of variations (such as color or size). You also have the
    option to Display the product, even if you\'re out of stock. If you
    want to allow back orders, also check the Allow orders even if not
    available option. The Track inventory by variations radio button
    will allow you to enter quantities later for each variation
    combination.

##### Build Shopping Pages

> Before trying to build shopping pages, your Sitefinity administrator
> needs to perform [configuration steps]{.underline} that support the
> shopping experience, including setting up the store, payment methods,
> shipping methods and taxes. Once the configuration is complete you can
> create the shopping pages. Minimally, to create a Sitefinity shopping
> experience you need:

    page visitors will use to shop and select products. This page will
    also contain a Shopping cart summary widget used to navigate to the
    shopping cart page.

-   A page containing a Shopping cart widget. The shopping cart will
    display selected products, quantities and totals. The user can
    select the Continue shopping widget to navigate back to the products
    list page or click the Checkout button to navigate to a checkout
    page to place their order.

-   A page that contains a Checkout widget. The Checkout widget is a
    wizard that walks the user through 5 steps: Shipping information \>
    Shipping options \> Payment \> Preview \> Confirmation.

> To build a page that allows shopping using configured ecommerce items,

Custom Modules
==============

> Sitefinity has numerous content modules right out of the box such as
> news, events, and blogs and so on. The built-in types cover many
> standard scenarios, but your organization may need to store custom
> data, for example \"Press Releases\", \"Stock Quotes\" or \"Employee
> Bio\". Such custom types of data are stored in Sitefinity custom
> *modules*. Modules allow you to extend Sitefinity with custom content
> administration pages and front end page widgets. The administration
> back-end pages allow you to enter new data and the widgets display the
> data in various formats in your pages.
>
> This section explains how to work with modules that handle custom data
> and includes how to create a custom module, add content to the module
> and add a module widget to a page. You will also learn how to
> customize the columns on the backend grid that displays module data.
>
> Once your module is created, you can temporarily deactivate it from
> use without having to delete it. This prevents changes to the module
> while preserving module data. You can also export the entire module
> along with any data that it has or just the module structure by
> itself. In this way you can import the structure to another Sitefinity
> site without having to describe all the fields of the module by hand.
> You can also completely delete a module and it will vanish from the
> site.
>
> The steps to create custom content types and use those types in a page
> are:

1.  [[ Create an empty custom
    module]{.underline}](#create-a-new-custom-module)

2.  [[ Add module content]{.underline}](#_bookmark25)

##### Manage Pages

> As you build your production website, it becomes harder to locate
> pages when you want to maintain them. The Manage Pages area to the
> right of the page list allows you to filter pages quickly. The filters
> in the screenshot below are not random, but reflect Telerik\'s
> experience working with Sitefinity customers in real-world situations.
> For
>

> lack of descriptions or keywords are not best practice for Search
> Engine Optimization.
>
> You can use the With No Keywords filter for example to get the pages
> where keywords were left out. You can, of course, just filter to show
> only your own pages. Using the by Date modified\... filter you can
> look at the most recent changes, or use a custom date and time range.
>
> The Manage also \> Templates option is a shortcut for Design \> Page

> The Permissions for all pages option allows you to change the access
> to all pages at one time. This option controls what roles can view,
> edit, modify, and change permissions and so forth.

> The [[Custom fields for page]{.underline}](#_bookmark5) option allows
> you to attach extra information to your page.

##### Function Bar

> The buttons along the top of the pages list work against all selected
> pages at one time. The checkboxes to the left of each page indicate
> which pages are affected. You can Create a child of the selected page
> to extend the hierarchy of pages. The More actions drop down menu
> includes the ability to change the page Template (i.e. the predefined
> overall layout of the page). You can also restructure your page by
> dragging and dropping pages.

##### Sharing Pages with Unauthorized Users

> You may need to share page links with people that don't have a user
> name or password in your Sitefinity site. For example, you may want
> reviewers to see pages even though they are not authorized on your
> system. You can even share a link to the draft of a page before it
> becomes published, as well as have the link expire on a given day.
>
> PAGE ADMINISTRATION \| 235
>
> You will need to change administration settings to allow sharing with
> unauthorized users and also create a preview link.
>
> Using the Sitefinity administration menu, first navigate to
> Administration \> Settings, then click the Advanced link. Then click
> the Pages node of the left hand tree view. Verify that the Allow
> backend users to share link to preview pages option is checked. Also
> inspect the Expiration time for shared links entry for the number of
> hours before the shared links expire. If you make any changes from the
> default values, click the Save changes button.

##### Custom Fields for Pages

> The ability to create your own arbitrary fields for pages has been a
> top customer request. The *custom fields for pages* feature now allow
> you to specify additional details for a page. Once a custom field is
> created, the field is associated with the page from then on. It's an
> all-in-one tool that you can use for multiple purposes as your
> requirements dictate. You can use custom fields to associate
> information with the page such as manufacturer, costs or priorities.
> You can also use custom fields to customize
>
> PAGE ADMINISTRATION \| 237
>
> how a particular page is rendered. For example, you could include
> custom banner images, icons or other styling for each page based on a
> custom field.
>
> **Note**: You can [define custom fields just like this for the other
> content types]{.underline} and for [custom data types]{.underline}.
>
> To create a custom field, navigate to Pages from the administration
> menu. On the right- hand side under Manage Pages, click the Custom
> fields link.

##### Personalization

> Personalization lets you display different versions of a page to those
> that belong to a particular *user segment*. A *user segment* is a
> collection of characteristics that define a group of people, such as
> how long the user stays on the site, the time of day, the user's
> preferred language, the number of blog posts the user has contributed,
> what items or types of items they've purchased, what page they landed
> on and many others. If a user spends a long time on the *Luxury Car
> Trends* page you could display a *Suggestions for You* page that has
> luxury cars and products. A user that purchases sleeping bags and camp
> stoves could be shown outdoor gear. The user effectively gets a custom
> page.
>
> Before you can personalize pages, your administrator needs to set up
> user segments in Marketing \> Personalization. For this example, there
> is a *Luxury Cars* segment and a *Clothes* segment.
>
> PAGE ADMINISTRATION \| 241
>
> To personalize a page, you can either start from the Pages
> administration and select Personalization from the Actions drop down
> list or you can edit a page and click the Personalize this page
> button. In this example, we start by editing a new page called
> *Suggestions*. The page has a single content block at the top with
> text *Suggestions for you* in a heading style. From here:

1.  Click the Personalize this page from the top right row of buttons.

![](./media/image564.png){width="6.020138888888889in"
height="2.8354166666666667in"}

2.  Select a user segment from the drop down list, then click the Create
    and go to edit content button.

> Notice that the page title *Suggestions* is appended with a drop down
> list that displays *Luxury Cars*. The list will include each
> personalization and an entry for *Everyone*.

3.  In this example an Image widget is added that displays a luxury car.

> PAGE ADMINISTRATION \| 243

4.  You can repeat these steps, starting with clicking the Personalize
    this page button, for every user segment. For example, we can
    personalize the page for the Clothes user segment by adding an
    Ecommerce product list widget.
