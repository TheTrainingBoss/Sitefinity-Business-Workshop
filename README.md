Ecommerce
=========

##### Build the Products Catalog

> Before you can build a shopping page, a shopping cart and a checkout
> page, you need to setup a catalog of products you want to sell. The
> Ecommerce menu lets you define Products (T-Shirt, baseball cap), Types
> of Products (shirts, hats), and Departments (Clothing, Mens, and
> Womens) and Attributes (size, color).

![](./media/image393.png){width="2.514132764654418in" height="4.5625in"}

##### Departments

> Departments are used to group products. In an example where we are
> selling caps and t-shirts, the department could be *Clothing*.
> Departments are hierarchical, so you could, for example, also create
> sub departments for *Mens*, *Womens*, *Girls* and *Boys* under the
> *Clothing* department.
>
> 166 \| ECOMMERCE

1.  To get started, click the Departments menu item.

2.  Click the Create a department link to create the first item. Enter
    the name of the department. You can also add a Description or
    customize the URL (not shown in the screenshot below). Then click
    Create and add another button.

##### Types of products

> Product types help describe how a certain group of products will be
> delivered to the customer. The product can be a traditional shippable
> product, but could also be a downloadable product like software or
> music or even a service or other non-shippable product like a
> subscription.
>
> Fields are added to the product type to describe it further. By
> default, product types start out with Tags and Department fields. Your
> own custom fields take the place of product labeling such as brand
> names, manufacturer codes, ingredients, classifications and codes.
> Using the example of a t-shirt, you could add a brand name, country of
> manufacture, type of fiber and washing instructions.
>
> To create a product type:

1.  First select Types of products from the Ecommerce menu

2.  Click the Create product type button.

> 168 \| ECOMMERCE

    radio buttons under This type contains\..., choose how the product
    type should be delivered to the customer. Click the Create this
    product type and go define its fields button. The screenshot below
    shows a *Shirt* product type that will be delivered by conventional

    and behaves in Sitefinity. In the Labels and text tab, provide a
    Label that will be used when entering data for the product. The
    Instructional text will be displayed below the textbox for the
    field. You can add a Predefined value as a default. Select the Make
    required checkbox if this field must be filled. The Limitations tab
    is used for numeric and date fields to restrict what can be entered.
    The Appearance tab controls where the field will be shown.

##### Attributes

> Products have traits like color or size called *attributes*. A
> t-shirt, for example, can come in small, medium and large sizes and
> also can be red, blue or green. Sitefinity can keep track of these,
> even to the point of tracking inventory for each combination. To
> define attributes:

1.  From the Ecommerce menu select Attributes.

2.  Click the Create an attribute link or button.

3.  Enter the name of the attribute. In the This attribute can be
    applied to area, select only the product types where the attribute
    makes sense. In the screenshot, the Color attribute applies to the
    Shirt product type, but not to Software or Song. Leave the other
    defaults and click the Create this attribute button.

6.  In the Attributes page, create as many attributes as needed to
    describe all the products you want to sell. The list of attributes
    in the screenshot below shows a summary of the values, and what
    product types the attribute applies to.

##### Products

> Now that [[Departments]{.underline},](#departments) [[Types of
> products]{.underline}](#types-of-products) and
> [[Attributes]{.underline}](#attributes) are defined, you can define
> the individual products. To create the product, you will need to have
> the product name, description, information for any of the fields that
> you defined, the shipping weight, the department that the product is
> part of, price and SKU (stock keeping unit). You may also want to get
> images of each product and have them available on your computer or
> upload them to an image library before defining products. The example
> that follows will create a t-shirt product in several different sizes
> and colors. To create a new product:

1.  From the Ecommerce menu select Products.

2.  You will have a choice of product types to start from. The
    screenshot below uses the Shirt product type.

![](./media/image406.png){width="1.9805304024496937in"
height="2.7974989063867017in"}

> 176 \| ECOMMERCE

3.  In the first block of information you need to enter the product
    Title and Description, the shipping Weight of the product.

![](./media/image407.png){width="6.020517279090114in"
height="4.0203116797900265in"}

ECOMMERCE \| 177

4.  The next block of entry includes the Departments and Tags. Select
    the Departments and sub departments that the product is part of and
    any Tags that will help people find the product. In the screenshot
    below, the *Clothing* and *Mens* departments are selected.

![](./media/image408.png){width="5.947187226596675in"
height="3.6129166666666666in"}

> 178 \| ECOMMERCE

5.  Next, define the Price, SKU and inventory options for the product.
    The monetary units for the price can be adjusted later in the
    Ecommerce [[ Configuration]{.underline}.](#_bookmark22) The SKU
    (Stock Keeping Unit) can use the numbering system for your store.
    Sitefinity will keep track of basic inventory. The Track inventory
    radio button option allows you to enter a Quantity for all products,
    regardless of variations (such as color or size). You also have the
    option to Display the product, even if you\'re out of stock. If you
    want to allow back orders, also check the Allow orders even if not
    available option. The Track inventory by variations radio button
    will allow you to enter quantities later for each variation
    combination.

![](./media/image409.jpeg){width="5.9494214785651796in"
height="3.430833333333333in"}

> Optionally, you can define Tier Pricing to encourage buyers to buy
> larger lots of product and Sale price for a certain period of dates.
> You can specify that the sale period start and end at specific times
> of the day.

> []{#_bookmark22 .anchor}180 \| ECOMMERCE

6.  Images really help sell the product. The next block of entry allows
    you to enter multiple images and documents. In the screenshot below,
    four t-shirts images display. Any one of the images can be tagged as
    Primary using the drop down Actions button. The Products List widget
    that will display on a page shows all the images, with the Primary
    image displaying larger and above the others. Use the Documents and
    other files button to upload documents for the customer that
    describe some aspect of the product in great detail, such as
    ingredients, manufacturing details or electronic specifications.

![](./media/image411.jpeg){width="6.002037401574803in"
height="2.7609372265966754in"}

7.  The More options section has a useful Role drop down. When the
    product is purchased, the role is assigned to the user, potentially
    giving them access to downloads or other resources.

##### Build Shopping Pages

> Before trying to build shopping pages, your Sitefinity administrator
> needs to perform [configuration steps]{.underline} that support the
> shopping experience, including setting up the store, payment methods,
> shipping methods and taxes. Once the configuration is complete you can
> create the shopping pages. Minimally, to create a Sitefinity shopping
> experience you need:

-   A products page that contains a Product list widget. This is the
    page visitors will use to shop and select products. This page will
    also contain a Shopping cart summary widget used to navigate to the
    shopping cart page.

-   A page containing a Shopping cart widget. The shopping cart will
    display selected products, quantities and totals. The user can
    select the Continue shopping widget to navigate back to the products
    list page or click the Checkout button to navigate to a checkout
    page to place their order.

-   A page that contains a Checkout widget. The Checkout widget is a
    wizard that walks the user through 5 steps: Shipping information \>
    Shipping options \> Payment \> Preview \> Confirmation.

> To build a page that allows shopping using configured ecommerce items,
> first add all three pages:

1.  Select Pages from the Sitefinity menu.

    List* page.

> 198 \| CUSTOM MODULES

Custom Modules
==============

> Sitefinity has numerous content modules right out of the box such as
> news, events, and blogs and so on. The built-in types cover many
> standard scenarios, but your organization may need to store custom
> data, for example \"Press Releases\", \"Stock Quotes\" or \"Employee
> Bio\". Such custom types of data are stored in Sitefinity custom
> *modules*. Modules allow you to extend Sitefinity with custom content
> administration pages and front end page widgets. The administration
> back-end pages allow you to enter new data and the widgets display the
> data in various formats in your pages.
>
> This section explains how to work with modules that handle custom data
> and includes how to create a custom module, add content to the module
> and add a module widget to a page. You will also learn how to
> customize the columns on the backend grid that displays module data.
>
> Once your module is created, you can temporarily deactivate it from
> use without having to delete it. This prevents changes to the module
> while preserving module data. You can also export the entire module
> along with any data that it has or just the module structure by
> itself. In this way you can import the structure to another Sitefinity
> site without having to describe all the fields of the module by hand.
> You can also completely delete a module and it will vanish from the

##### Manage Pages

> As you build your production website, it becomes harder to locate
> pages when you want to maintain them. The Manage Pages area to the
> right of the page list allows you to filter pages quickly. The filters
> in the screenshot below are not random, but reflect Telerik\'s
> experience working with Sitefinity customers in real-world situations.

> You can use the With No Keywords filter for example to get the pages

##### Function Bar

> The buttons along the top of the pages list work against all selected

> includes the ability to change the page Template (i.e. the predefined
> overall layout of the page). You can also restructure your page by
> dragging and dropping pages.

##### Sharing Pages with Unauthorized Users

> You may need to share page links with people that don't have a user
> name or password in your Sitefinity site. For example, you may want
> reviewers to see pages even though they are not authorized on your
> system. You can even share a link to the draft of a page before it
> becomes published, as well as have the link expire on a given day.
>
> PAGE ADMINISTRATION \| 235
>
> You will need to change administration settings to allow sharing with
> unauthorized users and also create a preview link.
>
> Using the Sitefinity administration menu, first navigate to
> Administration \> Settings, then click the Advanced link. Then click
> the Pages node of the left hand tree view. Verify that the Allow
> backend users to share link to preview pages option is checked. Also
> inspect the Expiration time for shared links entry for the number of
> hours before the shared links expire. If you make any changes from the
> default values, click the Save changes button.

##### Custom Fields for Pages

> The ability to create your own arbitrary fields for pages has been a
> top customer request. The *custom fields for pages* feature now allow
> you to specify additional details for a page. Once a custom field is
> created, the field is associated with the page from then on. It's an
> all-in-one tool that you can use for multiple purposes as your
> requirements dictate. You can use custom fields to associate
> information with the page such as manufacturer, costs or priorities.
> You can also use custom fields to customize
>
> PAGE ADMINISTRATION \| 237

> how a particular page is rendered. For example, you could include
> custom banner images, icons or other styling for each page based on a
> custom field.

> **Note**: You can [define custom fields just like this for the other

##### Personalization

> Personalization lets you display different versions of a page to those
> that belong to a particular *user segment*. A *user segment* is a
> collection of characteristics that define a group of people, such as
> how long the user stays on the site, the time of day, the user's
> preferred language, the number of blog posts the user has contributed,
> what items or types of items they've purchased, what page they landed
> on and many others. If a user spends a long time on the *Luxury Car
> Trends* page you could display a *Suggestions for You* page that has
> luxury cars and products. A user that purchases sleeping bags and camp
> stoves could be shown outdoor gear. The user effectively gets a custom
> page.
>
> Before you can personalize pages, your administrator needs to set up
> user segments in Marketing \> Personalization. For this example, there
> is a *Luxury Cars* segment and a *Clothes* segment.
>
> PAGE ADMINISTRATION \| 241
>
> To personalize a page, you can either start from the Pages
> administration and select Personalization from the Actions drop down
> list or you can edit a page and click the Personalize this page
> button. In this example, we start by editing a new page called
> *Suggestions*. The page has a single content block at the top with
> text *Suggestions for you* in a heading style. From here:

1.  Click the Personalize this page from the top right row of buttons.

![](./media/image564.png){width="6.020138888888889in"
height="2.8354166666666667in"}

2.  Select a user segment from the drop down list, then click the Create
    and go to edit content button.

> Notice that the page title *Suggestions* is appended with a drop down
> list that displays *Luxury Cars*. The list will include each
> personalization and an entry for *Everyone*.

> PAGE ADMINISTRATION \| 243

4.  You can repeat these steps, starting with clicking the Personalize
    this page button, for every user segment. For example, we can
    personalize the page for the Clothes user segment by adding an
    Ecommerce product list widget.
