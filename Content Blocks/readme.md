Content Blocks
==============

> News, Events and Content Blocks are similar to one another with only
> minor variations. The simplest item of the three is the Content Block
> which contains only a title and some HTML. Content blocks can be
> shared across multiple pages, just as with any other content, or can
> be ad-hoc, one-off material used in a single Content Block widget on a
> single page.
>
> The HTML for the content block can range from blocks of legal language
> to images and links, anything you want to include in various places on
> your site that needs to be maintained in a single spot.

##### Create a Content Block from the Content Menu

> If you want to create a content block that can be shared among pages
> and maintained from the Content menu:

1.  Drop down the Content menu and select Content blocks.

    you will see the \"No Content Blocks have been created yet\"
    message. Click the Create a content block link. This will display
    the Create a content block page.
