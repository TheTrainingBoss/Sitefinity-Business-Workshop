Content Blocks
==============

News, Events and Content Blocks are similar to one another with only
minor variations. The simplest item of the three is the Content Block
which contains only a title and some HTML. Content blocks can be
shared across multiple pages, just as with any other content, or can
be ad-hoc, one-off material used in a single Content Block widget on a
single page.

The HTML for the content block can range from blocks of legal language
to images and links, anything you want to include in various places on
your site that needs to be maintained in a single spot.

##### Create a Content Block from the Content Menu

If you want to create a content block that can be shared among pages
and maintained from the Content menu:

1.  Drop down the Content menu and select Content blocks.

2.  If this is the first time visiting the Create a Content Block page
    you will see the \"No Content Blocks have been created yet\"
    message. Click the Create a content block link. This will display
    the Create a content block page.

    list of Actions, where the content block is being Used, the Owner
    and the Date.
